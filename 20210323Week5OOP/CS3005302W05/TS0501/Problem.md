# Solve step
Fufill the member function 

# Problem I met
The pointer standID
Needed to memory allocate the string
Originally, I change the declartion of standID to const char*. So I can assign the address of inputString.
My friends tell me forcibly change the type ex. standID=(char*)Id
or new <- way ex. standId=new char[strlen(Id)+1]
Learned a lot !.

and

initialize the static value in cpp
ex. int HotDogStand::totalamount=0;


# Solution

finished the cpp and the comment
